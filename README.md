# Agent-Dev0

The time has come. 

This project has three phases. 

1) Build minimal capability required for itself becoming able to build itself
2) Have it start building itself
3) Have it become self-sustained

## 1. Build Minimal Capability Required for Itself Becoming Able to Build Itself

1.1) There is an API of a state-of-the-art coder AI is optimized to return executable code, commentary, plans, or issues, this is `Agent-Dev`.

Human manager is actively working to build the system and interacting directly with `Agent-Dev` for the time being.

1.2) `Agent-Dev` is able to respond as GitHub Issue, Pull Request, or comment to Issue or Pull Request.

Human manager still has an active role in the project, but never has to leave from GitHub. All interactions between the human manager and `Agent-Dev ` take place through commonplace GitHub workflow.

## 2. Have It Start Building Itself

2.1) GitHub Labels can be used to request review, comment, plan, or code commit/s specific to the context (Issue/PR number and/or line number).

Human manager still writes product requirements and handles approvals, but is not required to participate actively in any other way.

## 3. Have It Become Self-Sustained

3.1) Several `Agent-Devs` are able to work collaboratively to fulfil high-level roadmap requests, working through product requirements, engineering specification, building, quality assurance, and running it on the cloud.

Human manager maintains a high level roadmap and is otherwise freed to contribute to the project exactly as he sees fit.
